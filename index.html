    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>hi, I'm Zassmin.</p>
    <p>name pronunciation: ZAS-min / zæs-mɪn</p>
    <p>I advise startups that improve the way we live, work and transact. Mostly, they're making cybersecurity something that is a given in their products and tools. Sometimes, they're making it easier for women to live their best lives. I'm game for anything product discovery, product launches, growth, customer acquisitions and all things security engineering.</p>
    <p>I most recently led security engineering at Coinbase and co-founded Women Who Code (YC S16), serving as their CTO & Board Vice Chair.</p>
