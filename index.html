    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>hi, I'm Zassmin.</p>
    <p>name pronunciation: ZAS-min / zæs-mɪn</p>
    <p>I advise startups that improve the way we live, work and transact.</p>
    <p>I most recently led security engineering at Coinbase and co-founded Women Who Code (YC S16), serving as their CTO & Board Vice Chair.</p>
    <h2>advising</h2>
    <p>I'm supporting Founders and Technical Leaders in the following ways:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Build a Security Program based on the startup's risk profile and appetite.</li>
      <li>Defense in depth threat model of a specific product flow.</li>
      <li>Design and orchestrate a Table Top. This prepares and empowers teams to address a critical threat by stimulating it in a sandbox environment.</li>
      <li>Identify security hiring needs, from first hire to Security org. Design the right roles, interview rounds, and profiles.</li>
    </ul>
